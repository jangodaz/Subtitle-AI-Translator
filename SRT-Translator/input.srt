Hello and welcome to this lecture.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:06,740
And in this lecture we will have a brief overview about Django.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,230
So what exactly is Django so to understand Django.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,260
Let's take an example of a social networking website.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,730
So let's say if you want to access a social networking website like Facebook.

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,590
So what you essentially do is that you open up your browser and you send a request to the browser for

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:34,580
example you open up the browser you type in some you are like Facebook dot com slash the user name.

8
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,560
So let's say for example you want to extract the information of a user from a social media Web site.

9
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:48,180
If you want to access information of a particular user you type in facebook dot com slash the name of

10
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,380
that particular user.

11
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:57,000
So you type this thing in into your browser and what your browser does is that the browser takes this

12
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,480
you are a request and it sends it to the so what.

13
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,890
So this right here is let's assume Facebook server.

14
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:09,120
So now the job of the server is to take your request.

15
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:15,540
It's going to read your request and depending upon what data you have requested it's going to look at

16
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,010
that data and then it's going to find a data of User 1.

17
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,870
And it's going to send back a response.

18
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:28,800
So this response is going to be nothing but the profile of that particular user.

19
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:36,510
So for example let's say if you type in facebook dot com slash your user name you will get your user

20
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,190
profile.

21
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,980
So this is the entire process which happens when you request for a particular web page from a server.

22
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:51,270
So this entire thing is nothing but what happens when you access any kind of Web site on the Internet.

23
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,960
So what essentially happens is that you type in a you URL in your browser.

24
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,990
And now that browser is actually going to send that you are all to the specific server and request back

25
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,380
some data.

26
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:09,210
Now the server was are programmed in such a way that they can handle your request and return an appropriate

27
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,250
response.

28
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,310
So this is exactly what happened here.

29
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:19,170
But now the main question is how exactly does this particular server know which kind of page or what

30
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,870
kind of data it needs to return back to the browser.

31
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:28,050
So the server actually knows this stuff because the SO is actually programmed to handle these client

32
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,620
requests and send back appropriate response.

33
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,000
Now how exactly can we program these so was.

34
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,730
So that's where Django comes into picture.

35
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,700
So what exactly is Django.

36
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,560
Django is a free and open source Web application framework.

37
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:51,210
So whenever you want to build a web application we use Django and Django is nothing but a framework

38
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:58,890
and a framework is nothing but a collection of multiple components which we can use to build a web application.

39
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:04,830
So as I earlier mentioned a framework is nothing but a collection of components which allows us to build

40
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,940
sites faster.

41
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,720
So as I earlier mentioned we need to program so was and which angle we can do exactly the same.

42
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:19,200
So Django is called as a backend framework because Django is used for programming the so was and not

43
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,510
at the front end.

44
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:26,670
So this is the very specific reason why we call Django as a pack and framework because it is used to

45
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:36,360
program the backend that is the server was now Django also has an automatic admin interface which supports

46
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:36,960
crud.

47
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:44,340
Now if you build any kind of a website so let's say for example you're building an e-commerce Web site.

48
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,290
So for that very specific site you also need to build an admin panel as well.

49
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:56,040
So for example there is going to be an admin which is nothing but the main person who is going to handle

50
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:03,550
that entire site and that admin should be allowed to create read update and delete all the data from

51
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,640
this site.

52
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:09,690
So for that very purpose you need to provide an admin panel for a particular Web site.

53
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:16,590
But with Django Django actually has a feature which provides an automatic admin interface so that you

54
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,860
don't have to design it from scratch.

55
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,420
So this is one of the features of Django which we are going to look into.

56
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,840
So that was a brief introduction about what exactly Django is.

57
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:32,300
So the only thing which you need to keep in mind for now is that Django is used for programming the

58
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:39,330
so was so that they can return an appropriate response back to the client and Django is nothing but

59
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:45,240
a framework which is a back end framework and a framework is nothing but a collection of components.

60
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:52,620
So a framework is nothing but it's essentially a bunch of code which we can reuse to build sites faster.

61
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:59,130
So without wasting any time in the upcoming lecture we will start building over application with Django.
